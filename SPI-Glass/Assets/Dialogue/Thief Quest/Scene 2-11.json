What happens here should very much concern you SPI members, if you want to keep the living world free of ghosts.

I guess there’s no hiding it now. He’s the reason why I’m so weak. ","#","^speaker:Archibald ","/#","#","^portrait:archibald","/#","\n","^I see. So you are the ghost that lost to him in a fight and had your strength absorbed. ","#","^speaker:Vincenzo ","/#","#","^portrait:0","/#","\n","^I’m surprised you escaped him before he consumed you completely.","\n","^It’s not like I meant for that to happen.

","#","^speaker:Vincenzo ","/#","#","^portrait:0","/#","\n","^To do that, he needs power — a lot of it. Which takes us to the [Crown Name].","\n","^If he gets it, he’ll control all ghosts weaker than him to flood the living world.

","#","^speaker:Vincenzo ","/#","#","^portrait:0","/#","\n","^I need someone to investigate him. Someone that he cannot absorb and will not fall under his control or influence.","\n","^You just want a scapegoat, don’t you?
